# Loops

## For

A for loop alows you to iterate throught the elements of an iterable.

Changing the iterable as part of the Loop is NOT recommended. Instead you can create a copy. 

## While

A while loop allows you to repeat code as long as its condition is True. 

Makesure to provide an skip condition. 

# Conditions

==
!=
is
in
is not
not in 
<=
>=
